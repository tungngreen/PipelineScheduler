* inference's downstreams' `nb_expectedshape`s should be the same as post processor's `msvc_dataShape`
* Receiver's `msvc_dataShape` should be set during profiling
    * The list of `msvc_dataShape` is the list of potential shapes for profiling.
* postprocessor's downstreams' `nb_commMethod` should be matched with sender's downstreams' `nb_commMethod`
    * If sender communicates CPU data (`nb_commMethod = 2 or 3), it requires CPU requests from postprocessor.
    * Thus, in such a case, postprocessor's downstreams' `nb_commMethod` should be 3

### Configurations
The **Container Agent** relies on a json configuration file specifying the details of microservices inside each container.
The current container configurations are store [here](/jsons).
It is worth taking a look at their structures before proceeding to the next part.

Besides general metadata like:
```json
    "cont_experimentName": "prof",
    "cont_systemName": "octocross",
    "cont_pipeName": "traffic",
    "cont_taskName": "retina1face",
    "cont_hostDevice": "server",
    "cont_hostDeviceType": "server",
    "cont_name": "retinaface_0",
```

The microservice details are defined under `"cont_pipeline"`. This is what the example of the `Preprocessor` for model Retina Face.
